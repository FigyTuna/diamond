Click on index.html to see the game code.

This game uses PIXI, which basically draws stuff on a screen.

Right now the code is simple and messy but if you can understand some things in index.html then you can try downloading a copy for yourself and messing with it.
I encourage you to try and understand it or if you're not much of a coder, think of design ideas that coders will them implement. Post your ideas in the groups or on the drive.
