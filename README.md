A game being made by the Tech Club Game Team.

This game uses PIXI, which basically draws stuff on a screen.

The game's code is mostly in index.html and mapmaker.html .
Right now the only really terrible thing in the code is the collision correction.
Otherwise look over the code and ask me questions if you have any.
